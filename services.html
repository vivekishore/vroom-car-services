                <h3>BATTERY</h3>
                <p>Avoid unexpected breakdowns and unwanted repair bills by checking the health and condition of your
                    car's battery. Batteries are more susceptible to failure, so a few simple checks can help make sure
                    it's performing at its best.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="services-col">
                <h3>BRAKES</h3>
                <p>Out of the many parts in a brake system, the disc/rotor and pads could be considered the most
                    important. The rotor is attached to the hub of the axle and the pads are mounted on the rotors. For
                    efficient braking, you have to make sure both these components are in their best working condition.
                </p>

            <div class="services-col">
                <h3>OIL FILTER</h3>
                <p>Engine oil loses its effectiveness over time and needs to be replaced to extend the life of your
                    car's engine. It is also essential to replace the oil filter every time your car's engine oil is
                    replaced as this aids the oil being contamination and sludge free. Hence, oil change and oil filter
                    replacement go hand in hand!</p>
